# Arbiter
A Platform Agnostic Evaluation tool and Scoring Engine for Machine Learning algorithms.

1. Hyperparameter Optimization
     - Grid Search
     - Bayesian Optimization
     - Random Search

  Given a group of trained models, rank them over several runs. The system keeps a record of the
  configurations used to train the models.

2. Scoring Engine for serving user requests against a trained Model
