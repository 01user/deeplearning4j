## Local or remote execution?

Because datasets are commonly large by nature, you can decide on an execution mechanism that best suits your needs. For example, if you are vectorizing a large training dataset, you can process it in a distributed Spark cluster. However, if you need to do real-time inference, DataVec also provides a local executor that doesn't require any additional setup.
